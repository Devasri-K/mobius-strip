# mobius-strip

This Python project models a Mobius strip using basic parametric equations and calculates:
  - Surface Area
  - Edge Length

Approximation Techniques
- Surface area is estimated by dividing the surface into small triangles and summing their areas.
- Edge length is approximated by summing distances between points along the top and bottom edges.
